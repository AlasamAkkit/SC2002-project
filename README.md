# SC2002 Project

## Hospital Management System (HMS)
Hospital Management System (HMS) is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application designed using the object-oriented design approach to automate the management of hospital operations.

This project was done by SCS4 Group 3

## Approach Taken
HMS uses the entity-control-boundary (ECB) class stereotypes for better organization and maintainability of classes in the application.
